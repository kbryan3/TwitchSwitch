4. Provide screen shot showing the connection interval settings. Do they match the values you set in your slave(server) code or the master's values?.
   Answer:  They do not match the values set in server's code, so they are the client's value.

6. If possible, provide screen shot verifying the slave latency matches what was reported when you logged the values from event = gecko_evt_le_connection_parameters_id.
   Answer: It is 30ms with 0 intervals, which matches question 4.
